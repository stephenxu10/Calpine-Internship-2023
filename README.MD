# 2023 Calpine Summer Internship Projects

## Description

A large repository storing the code I have written for my various tasks & projects during my 2023 Summer Internship at Calpine. For security purposes, most input & output data
files are not included in this repository. However, the code is largely unchanged.

## Usage

This code is intended to run on the Calpine Network's CA drive. Currently, all of the scripts, output data, and reports should be located at 
Y:\11_Transmission Analysis\ERCOT\101 - Misc\CRR Limit Aggregates. If, for some reason, this folder no longer exists, clone the contents into
a new repository and run from there. Please note that some scripts only work properly when ran from the intended folder - change the File I/O 
if necessary.
